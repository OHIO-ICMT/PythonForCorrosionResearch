    "## Packages and Environment Managers\n",
    "Python programming heavily relies upon the use of packages like NumPy. This notebook is being run in the python package Jupyter. Many are included by default in Python in the \"Standard Library\". The standard library includes packages like `sys` and `os` for dealing with the operating system, `tkinter` for simple GUIs, and `unittest` for unit testing. More info on standard library packages can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). \n",
    "\n",
    "An environment is used to contain and manage Python installations and the packages a particular program uses. It helps make sure that one application developed with Python 2 don't use packages developed for Python 3. Package and environment managers are critical is multiple people develop on the same project. Errors may arise if one developer is using a old version of a package and another is using the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "For people just now getting started with Python for data analytics, then I recommend to just create a single environment now and just keep using the same one for as long as it keeps working.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "We'll install Python through one of the two following methods: \n",
    "1. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)\n",
    "2. [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both installs use the Conda package and environment manager. It's generally the preferred manager in data science and scientific computing. Anaconda installs a ton of libraries to a base environment that ultimately are not needed, whereas miniconda just installs the conda package manager for the user to create a new environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use python with Conda, a user created environment must be used. While typically a `base` environment is created by default, but the user should create a new environment during setup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "If installing for the first time then when it prompts to add python to the path, accept. If not then no worries, just use Anaconda Prompt when we need to use a terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed then run the following commands (assuming using a Windows PC) in Command Prompt or Anaconda Prompt. Here `corrosion` is the name of the environment that we are creating. If you wish, you can use something else, but this tutorial will assume you are using the `corrosion` environment name. If it asks to proceed to install packages, please say yes by typing `y` and then hit enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `conda create -n corrosion python=3.9 numpy pandas matplotlib scipy jupyter seaborn`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates an environment called corrosion with python version 3.9 and the NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, SciPy, Jupyter, and Seaborn packages. We'll go through what these packages are in a future class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the created environment, use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `conda activate corrosion`\n",
    "\n",
    "The default package manager for python is `pip`, however anaconda and conda have an alternative package and environment manager. It's recommended to use the conda package manager whenever possible. Packages that cannot be installed by conda will require pip installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "To open Jupyter:\n",
    "1. Open a terminal (windows: command prompt or powershell) and `cd` to the desired working directory\n",
    "2. `jupyter notebook`\n"
